# Optical Character Recogniton

This project is implemented using Tesseract OCR for character recogniton in images and pdf.

Currently 4 languages are supported, English, Kannada, Tamil and Telegu.

A web interface is developed using Django framework, which allows users to upload an image or a pdf onto the webpage that returns the text grabbed from the file uploaded.

### Dependencies:

To install Django:

> pip install Django

Install dependencies for ocr:

> sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

> pip install pytesseract

To work with images:

> sudo pip install pillow

To work with pdf:

> sudo apt-get install imagemagick

> pip install wand

Other dependencies:

> pip install autocorrect

To download the trained data for Kannada,Tamil and Telegu, go to
`https://github.com/indic-ocr/tessdata/`
The respective trained data will be found in the folders `kan` `tam` and `tel`. Download and copy those file into `tessdata` in your local folder where `tesseract` is installed.

## Procedure:

At the terminal, go to the folder containing the project and type the following command to start the localhost server.
> python manage.py runserver

To tag the few proper nouns in english that might not be recognised corectly, run the `filtered.py` script.

`filtered.py` depends on nltk tokenizing modules. To install them, run-

> nltk.download('punkt')

#### The extraction is quite resource intensive and takes time(depends on the hardware used), especially if the uploaded file is a large pdf. It is advised to break the pdf into chunks of a couple of pages(5-6) per file and uploading them for quicker results.

The extracted text can also be found int the project folder in a text file `extracted.txt`.


#### To run extract text without web interface:
Install the dependencies mentioned earlier and just download the `ocr.py` file. Copy the file(from which text is to be extracted) into the folder containing `ocr.py`.

Run `ocr.py` on the command prompt/terminal.
> python ocr.py

After execution of the program, pass the file name to the following functions to get the extracted text printed on the terminal.
Extracted text can also be found in `extracted.txt` inside the same directory. 

`imgOcrEng('file_name')` : for English-Image

`pdfOcrEng('file_name')` : for English-pdf

Replace Eng with Kan,Tam or Tel for Kannada,Tamil or Telegu respectively.

### Note:If you are facing an error saying `normproto file is not in unichar set`, you have to install the support for indian languages' character set.
